## About
A simple tool for getting Windows Spotlight Images. The application creates a folder named "Spotlight Images" in the current folder and copies all Windows Spotlight images available in the currently logged on user's profile into it.

## Runtime Requirements
The application has the following runtime requirements:

1. Windows 10 (32 or 64 bit)

## Source Code
The file [spotlight_images.cpp](https://github.com/alecmus/spotlight_images/blob/master/spotlight_images.cpp) contains all the code required. However, there is also a Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 solution ([spotlight_images.sln](https://github.com/alecmus/spotlight_images/blob/master/spotlight_images.sln)) for convenience.
